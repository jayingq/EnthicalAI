# EnthicalAI
This is an suggestion of what we could do to improve ethical AI 
(The idea of this project is coming from an hackathon)


Framework:
We quantify ethical problem from three aspects:
1. Security: Phishing and malware website
2. Context: Fake news
3. Privacy: Detect user behaviour without tell user the process

The workflow is here:
